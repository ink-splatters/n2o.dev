Welcome to Erlang/N2O, DocOps!
==============================

<img src="https://n2o.dev/DEV.png?v=1"/>

N2O is Erlang and Elixir compatible set of libraries that covers full ERP application stack: NS and MQ buses, storage, business processes, ui, forms, complex controls elements, document management, etc. As Erlang/OTP stands for language and set of base libraries, you may call our stack Erlang/N2O or Elixir/N2O.

üíø KVS
------

KVS is the light version of client interface on top of BTREE database abstractions strive to support the basic features: Polymorphic tuples aka extensible records; Basic schema for chain storage; Backends: MNESIA, FS, ROCKS; Extremely compact and battle-tested: 500 LOC. This is an essence and fruit of KVS; the abstract term interface with naive yet productive stream implementation. Useful for simple blockchains, messaging, storage, processing systems, and banking industry. KVS is used in BPE and BANK applications.

‚òï REST
-------

REST is a framework with typed JSON. Features and Goals: Fastest possible Record <-> Proplists transformations; Smallest REST framework in the world (3 files drop); ETS/KVS/Any storage selection by scaffolding. We've achived first goal by providing parse_transform code generation for tuple transformations. And second requirement was achieved by not including routing bullshit and other uncertain features. 

üí† BPE
------

Business Processing for Enterprises (BPE) provides infrastructure for workflow definitions according to ISO-19510 BPMN 2.0 OMG standard. It can be used for process orchestration, rule based production systems and as transactional log. 

‚≠ï N2O
------
N2O is an embeddable message protocol loop library for WebSocket, MQTT and TCP servers. It provides basic features, such as: process management; virtual nodes ring for request processing; session, encoding, mq and cache services. 

üî• NITRO
--------
NITRO is Nitrogen-like Web Framework for Erlang/OTP. It can be used not only in web applications but also in console applications that need to perform an HTML5 rendering. 

üßæ FORM
-------
SYNRC FORM is a pure Erlang forms protocol for enterprise software. It suppors following target formats: XML, JSON, HTML, BML, SVG, JavaScript, BERT. 

‚òéÔ∏è RPC
------
RPC is a set of parse_transform modules that produce various encode/decode generators from Erlang HRL file type specifications. This is the most Erlang way possible. Supported Generators: Erlang validation according to Type Spec (BERT); JavaScript (BERT); Swift (BERT); Google Protobuf Specification (PROTOv3).

üõ°Ô∏è CA
-----
Open Source Certificate Authority (CA) by SYNRC. It provides Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with both: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), best suited for IoT security; and legacy Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman (RSA) cryptography. It supports CSR certificate enrollment and provides OCSP responder for fast revokation checking.
